# Roadmap

Everything deliberately left out of the MVP. The MVP is: Brandenburg terrain + canopy, ground
anchors only, one AOI, static viewer.

## Anchors

- **Tree-trunk anchors.** The dominant limitation right now. In the default AOI 55 % of the ground
  is under 15–30 m of pine, and a 2 m A-frame on a hilltop does not clear it — so the geometry
  says "line possible" while the canopy column says "unwalkable". Rigging in the trees is what
  people actually do here. Needs trunk detection rather than canopy height: the `als` classified
  LAZ point clouds can distinguish trunk from crown, and OSM `natural=tree` cross-checks isolated
  trees. Usable anchor height is roughly 80 % of trunk height.
- **No-fall-zone allowance.** Canopy intersection is acceptable close to the anchors — the walker
  is not going to fall there and the branches can be cleared — but must be strict through the
  bulk of the span. Model as a tolerance window of `max(5 m, 2 % of length)` at each end, inside
  which canopy is ignored, and enforce canopy clearance as a hard constraint outside it. This is
  what turns the canopy column from a score into a real filter.
- **Buildings as anchors.** `3d_gebaeude` LoD1/LoD2 CityGML gives per-building geometry and
  heights. Opens up urban highlines and is the point of extending to Berlin.
- **Anchor quality.** Rock vs. sand vs. loose spoil changes whether a ground anchor is riggable at
  all. Partly derivable from `alkis` land cover and geological maps.
- **Terrain-dependent attachment range.** Every ground anchor currently gets the same 0–2 m range.
  In reality a clean cliff edge can be rigged at ground level while a rounded slope needs a taller
  A-frame just to clear the lip, and a spot with no solid ground has no usable range at all. The
  local terrain shape in the line's direction already tells us which case we are in — it is
  computed during the openness scan and then thrown away.

## Physics

- **Real sag.** Replace the flat 4 %-of-span constant with a catenary under tension, parameterised
  by webbing, pretension and walker mass, and evaluate the worst load case rather than assuming
  midspan. The current model is good enough to rank candidates and not good enough to rig from.
- **Anchor loads.** Report the tension a candidate implies, which is what decides whether the
  anchors are adequate.

## Search quality

- **Better refinement.** The local hill-climb is coordinate descent over a small neighbourhood, so
  it only reaches a local optimum, and it only runs on candidates that survived deduplication.
  Two real improvements: refine before dedup instead of after (roughly a hundred times the work,
  but nothing good gets discarded first), and escape local optima — levelling one end often has to
  make the score temporarily worse before the other end catches up, which coordinate descent
  cannot see past.
- **Tighten the openness prefilter.** It currently only removes ~80 % of in-range pairs in high
  relief terrain, because a 5 m drop within 120 m is easy to satisfy where there is 38 m of relief.
  Scaling `minProbeDrop` to local relief would sharpen it.
- **Spatial index for pairing.** The plain double loop is fine for 1 km² but not for a region; a
  uniform grid keyed on `maxLength` makes the pair enumeration output-sensitive.
- **Validation set.** Import documented real highlines and assert the finder rediscovers them.
  Nothing else distinguishes "found 2000 candidates" from "found 2000 artefacts".

## Context the results need to be useful

- **Legal and access layer.** Nature protection (Naturschutzgebiet, Landschaftsschutzgebiet, FFH,
  Vogelschutzgebiet), forestry ownership, and — specifically for the default AOI — the former
  Soviet airfield and munitions areas around Sperenberg. A candidate you may not rig is noise.
- **Approach.** Distance and walking time from the nearest road or path via OSM.
- **Seasonality.** The surface model is a single epoch, so leaf-on vs leaf-off changes the canopy
  answer for deciduous stands.
- **Wind and sun exposure** from terrain, which is what makes a line pleasant rather than possible.

## Scale

- **All of Brandenburg + Berlin.** The blocker is data volume, not compute: the surface model is
  ~32 MB per km² zipped, so the whole state is ~950 GB. The cache must reduce to a 1 m normalised
  surface on ingest and discard the 0.2 m source. The openness scan is already per-tile
  independent, so it parallelises directly.
- **Other German states.** Each runs its own portal with its own tiling, formats and licence.
  NRW, Bavaria, Saxony and Thuringia all publish comparable 1 m models.
- **WCS instead of tile downloads.** `bb_dgm` serves arbitrary bounding boxes, which avoids
  fetching whole tiles for a small AOI.
- **Vector tiles for candidates.** One JSON stops working somewhere around 10⁴ candidates.

## Viewer

- 3D terrain view with the line drawn in space.
- Re-run the search in the browser against cached rasters, so parameters become interactive
  instead of requiring a pipeline run.
- Permalinks to a candidate, and GPX export for the walk in.
